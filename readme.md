## [Heroku Deployment](https://cryptic-mesa-90093.herokuapp.com/)

I have built an app called cooksBook. It is a repository of recipes to which registered users may upload recipes, edit existing recipes, and delete recipes as well.

## Approach

The MVP consists of a full CRUD application capable of displaying recipe data, taking in data from a form and saving to a database, selecting recipes from the database individually, and editting and deleting them.

This data manipulation is implemented in a modal-focused design. Instead of a layout rendering pages, the DOM is used to swap visual information.

## Usability

- Navbar:
  - Home: loads landing content
  - All Recipes: loads all content in database
  - New Recipe: opens modal to submit new recipe to database
  - Search: opens modal to submit keyword search on all of document's strings
  - Login: opens modal to being user session or register a new user
  - Logout: destroys user session
- Go To Recipe:
  - Opens individual recipe modal and displays document's content (iterates over arrays to create lists, buttons)
  - Edit: opens update modal to submit document changes (only available to logged-in user)
  - Delete: destroys individual document (only available to logged-in user)

## Technologies Used

- Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- Dom Manipulation - Vanilla JS and jQuery
- Data-handling - AJAX
- Backend - Mongoose, Express

## Stretch Goals

- Search for recipes based on a keyword which may be available in any text field.
- Allow user auth for edit/upload/delete capabilities.
- Styling done with Bootstrap
